How to control autobuilding

 Autobuilding packages is controlled with placing files in certain
 places. You can create those files yourself with "touch".

 The rules are:

 - If the file /etc/common-lisp/autobuild exists all
 packages for all compilers will be build.

 - If for a implementation foo the file
 /etc/common-lisp/foo/autobuild exists all packages
 for that implementation will be build.

 - If for a implementation foo and a package bar the
 file /etc/common-lisp/foo/bar/autobuild exists this
 package will be autobuild for that implementation.
