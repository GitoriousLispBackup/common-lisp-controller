What's wrong with releasing the source?

Problem with current available Lisp code:
sometimes implementation specific (rarely)
some use MK:DEFSYSTEM most use something all new and unique
most have hard-wired locations from where they need to be
most need source hacking before they compile

Compare this to: 

perl Makefile.pl ; make ; make install
