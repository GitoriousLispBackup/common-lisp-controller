Why is this a problem?


Problem: 
(time (+ (download X) (fight X))) 
<< 
(time (+ (study X) (write X)))

and

Perl people download, fight and send patches.
Lisp people study, write. Sometimes they release the source.

Most Perl users need solutions. 
Lisp users want to write yet-another scheme interpreter.
