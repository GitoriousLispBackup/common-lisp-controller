Why cmucl->c-l-c->cCLan?

Current situation:
Students and newbies of CMUCL, sbcl and clisp see:
A program with a UI from the early 70's
No obvious way to talk to DBMS, mail, news, snmp, CORBA etc
No way to do that cool servlet stuff
People that use ACL see a slightly better picture, but
Still many protocols are not supported (snmp, mail, GL)
Many extentions are over the top. For example: clim, AllegroStore are much too industrial for mere students
