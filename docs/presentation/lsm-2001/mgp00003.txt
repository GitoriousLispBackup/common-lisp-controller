What is c-l-c?

common-lisp-controller: standard for
installation Lisp library packages
compiling those packages for all available lisp implementations
making those packages then available with a simple 'require' for end-users

cCLan: CPAN but for lisp
at the moment mostly limited to debian packages (rpm on the way)
works on CMUCL and sbcl at the moment. ACL should work, clisp should too
