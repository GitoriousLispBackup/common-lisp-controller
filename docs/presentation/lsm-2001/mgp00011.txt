Why is it not needed to make dpkg in lisp.

Existing systems already have these functions. It has no use implementing our own system because:

we won't 'fit in' with the rest of the system
we won't get included into distributions: 'All students need to have Debian X' is a much easier requirement then 'Get CMUCL, clorb, mysql, ...'
there are more interesting and less painfull things in life
