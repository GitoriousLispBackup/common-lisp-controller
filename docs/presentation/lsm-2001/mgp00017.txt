An example of a library:


Cil (Chess In Lisp) is my default example.

Defsystem:

;;; -*- Mode: lisp -*-

;;; This is just a sample of building series with MK defsystem. You
;;; may need to change :source-pathname appropriately for your system.

(mk:defsystem cil
    :source-pathname "cl-library:cil;"
    :source-extension "lisp"
    :components ((:file "cil")))

This system only has one file: cil.lisp in cl-library:cil;
