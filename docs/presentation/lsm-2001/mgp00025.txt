cCLan


cCLan is much like CPAN:
 a system to make libraries available across distributions.

At the moment most packages are debian-based, mostly because most developers use debian.

Apt-able repository at:
deb http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/ftp/pub/debian local lisp
deb-src http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/ftp/pub/debian local lisp


Documentation and a skeleton-generator are in the design-fase.
