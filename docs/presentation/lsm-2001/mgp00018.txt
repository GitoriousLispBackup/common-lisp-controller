An example of a library II 

The source on a debian system then is 
/usr/share/common-lisp/repositories/cil/cil.lisp
and
/usr/share/common-lisp/source/cil/cil.lisp
the compiled file for cmucl-safe goes into:
/usr/lib/common-lisp/cmucl-safe/cil/cil.x86f

Why share/lib? share=shared between systems!

In the post-installation we have:
/usr/sbin/register-common-lisp-source cil

That's all folks!
