How about lisp libraries in distributions?

Some people released Lisp libraries 
into distributions like debian. 

Problems:
all depend on one version of a lisp implementation
lisp implementations do incompatible changes to themselves without changing version
need to coordinate lisp and lisp library releases

Solution: 

common-lisp-controller
