"asdf is used to load and compile Common Lisp libraries. Some libraries are "
"packaged in Debian packages and are loaded with Common Lisp Controller, in "

"In One World mode (the default) both CLC and manually added libraries are in "
"the same  world and can load eachother. Using \"(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :"

"risk that conflicts arrise between the two systems."

"In Two World mode you need to use clc-require to load CLC enabled packages "
"as the ASDF system does not know about the Debian packages libraries, only "
"CLC. The advantage of this is that there is less probability of conflicts, "
"the disavantage is that using asdf to load CLC enabled packages will not "
"work."
