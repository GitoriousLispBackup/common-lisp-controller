common-lisp-controller (7.0) unstable; urgency=low

  This new version uses asdf version 1.502 or higher so it only needs to
  install files in /etc/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/ in order
  for asdf to find it.

  CLC also uses the standard 'place binaries there' feature of asdf to 
  put the binaries in /var/cache/common-lisp. The problem is that this
  feature is opaque to us, so we cannot remove specifc libraries 
  or files for one implementation. For now we will nuke all 
  the fasl files in the cache when we add or remove a library or an
  implementation.

  This also means that clc enabled packages are _always_ active in asdf.

  As a bonus there is now also clc-clbuild which is a small wrapper round
  clbuild enabling you to download clbuild enabled packages.

common-lisp-controller (6.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * From version 6.19 onwards clc does not longer add the 
    /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/ directory to asdf:*central-registry*
    
    The net effect of this is that just using "(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op ...)" 
    will no longer work. The only way to load clc enabled packages now
    it to use "(clc:clc-require :<foo>)"
    
    You can also activate the clc packages using "clc:with-clc-active" so
    
    (clc:with-clc-active
      (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :<foo>))
    
    will work too.
    
    This change was done so that using for example clbuild in Debian becomes
    possible again. Otherwise the packaged systems will interfere with the
    clbuild or locally generated systems.
