 The rules are:
 .
 If the file /etc/common-lisp/autobuild exists all packages for all
 compilers will be built.
 .
 If for an implementation foo the file /etc/common-lisp/foo/autobuild
 exists all packages for that implementation will be build.
 .
 If for an implementation foo and a package bar the file
 /etc/common-lisp/foo/bar/autobuild exists this package will be autobuild
 for that implementation.
