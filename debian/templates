Template: common-lisp-controller/how-to-control
Type: note
Description: how to control autobuilding
 Autobuilding packages is controlled with
 placing files in certain places. You can create
 those files yourself with "touch".
 .
 The rules are:
 .
 If the file /etc/common-lisp/autobuild exists all
 packages for all compilers will be build.
 .
 If for a implementation foo the file 
 /etc/common-lisp/foo/autobuild exists all packages
 for that implementation will be build.
 .
 If for a implementation foo and a package bar the
 file /etc/common-lisp/foo/bar/autobuild exists this
 package will be autobuild for that implementation.
