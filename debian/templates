Template: common-lisp-controller/short-site-name
Type: string
#  Default site name
_Default: Unknown
_Description: Short Common Lisp site name:
 You can configure what the Common Lisp implementations are going to use as
 'short site name'.
 .
 This is mostly unused except in some error reporting tools.

Template: common-lisp-controller/long-site-name
Type: string
# Default long site name, just something longer than the default site name
_Default: Site name not initialized
_Description: Long Common Lisp site name:
 You can configure what the Common Lisp implementations are going to use as
 'long site name'.

Template: common-lisp-controller/one-world-mode
Type: boolean
_Default: true
_Description: One unified asdf world mode:
 asdf is used to load and compile Common Lisp libraries. Some libraries are
 packaged in Debian packages and are loaded with Common Lisp Controller,
 in particular using '(clc:clc-require :<name>)'. Other libraries can be
 added manually or by using other systems like for example clbuild.
 .
 There are two possible configuration options available: One world or Two world mode.
 .
 In One World mode (the default) both CLC and manually added libraries are in the same 
 world and can load eachother. Using "(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :<name)" will also 
 load CLC enabled packages. However there is a slight risk that conflicts arrise between
 the two systems.
 .
 In Two World mode you need to use clc-require to load CLC enabled packages as the ASDF system
 does not know about the Debian packages libraries, only CLC. The advantage of this is that
 there is less probability of conflicts, the disavantage is that using asdf to load CLC enabled
 packages will not work.
 .
 Do you want to enable One World mode?
