Template: common-lisp-controller/queue-only
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Only build lisp libraries daily
 Should all lisp libraries only be build by the nightly
 cronjob? If so all interactive user requests to recompile
 a library (by requiring it) will fail.
 .
 Setting this option might be advised if you want the
 update to finish early. Later you can manually run the
 daily cronjob to build all the libraries for the users.
 .
 Note that removal of libraries or implementations is immediate.

Template: common-lisp-controller/auto-build
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Autobuild LISP libraries for all LISP compilers?
 Should all libraries for all compilers be rebuilt as they are installed?
 .
 Note that this can take a significant amount of time on every install.

Template: common-lisp-controller/how-to-control
Type: note
_Description: Autobuilding control note
 Autobuilding packages is controlled with placing files in certain places.
 You can create those files yourself with "touch".
 .
 The rules are:
 .
 If the file /etc/common-lisp/autobuild exists all packages for all
 compilers will be built.
 .
 If for an implementation foo the file /etc/common-lisp/foo/autobuild
 exists all packages for that implementation will be build.
 .
 If for an implementation foo and a package bar the file
 /etc/common-lisp/foo/bar/autobuild exists this package will be autobuild
 for that implementation.

Template: common-lisp-controller/short-site-name
Type: string
_Default: Unknown
_Description: The short common LISP site name
 You can configure what the common LISP implementations are going to use as
 "short site name". This is mostly unused except in some error reporting
 tools.

Template: common-lisp-controller/long-site-name
Type: string
_Default: Site name not initialized
_Description: The long common LISP site name
 You can configure what the common LISP implementations are going to use as
 "long site name". This is mostly unused except in some error reporting
 tools.
