Common-Lisp-Controller for Debian
---------------------------------

To customize the CLC-generated images, add system names (one per line)
to /etc/common-lisp/images/implementation-name. For example. if you always
want McCLIM to be present in the default image of SBCL, create a file
/etc/common-lisp/images/sbcl containing the line "clim".
