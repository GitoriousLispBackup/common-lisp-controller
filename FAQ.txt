Q1: I want to hack my programs! How can I have my own repository?

A1: Just create a shadow-tree with symlinks or CVS in you
homedirectory and add an overriding translation in you startup
script. Like:

; my ~/.cmucl-init.cl file:
(load "/var/lib/cmucl/site-init.lisp")

(format t "Hello Peter!~%")

(common-lisp-controller:add-project-directory
 "/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/src/"
 "/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/fasl/"
 '("CLIM" "MCCLIM" "CLX" #+nil "CLOCC-PORT"
   "ECLIPSE"
   "HEMLOCK" #+nil "CMUCL-CLX" "CMUCL")
 "/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/systems/")

Q2: This sucks: register-common-lisp-source foo worked, but now
(require :foo) doesn't!

A2: Maybe the build failed. Make your lisp stop on errors. For cmucl
comment the "-batch -quiet" parameters out in
/usr/lib/common-lisp/bin/cmucl-*.sh. Then you'll be droped in the
debugger.
