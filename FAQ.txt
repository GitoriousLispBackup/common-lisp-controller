Q1: I want to hack my programs! How can I have my own repository?

A1: Just create a shadow-tree with symlinks or CVS in you
homedirectory and add an overriding translation in you startup
script. Like:

; my ~/.cmucl-init.cl file:
(load "/etc/common-lisp/cmucl/site-init.lisp")

(format t "Hello Peter!~%")

(common-lisp-controller:add-project-directory
 #p"/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/src/"
 #p"/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/fasl/"
 '("clue")
 #p"/home/pvaneynd/common-lisp/systems/")

Q2: This sucks: register-common-lisp-source foo worked, but now
(require :foo) doesn't!

A2: Maybe the build failed. Please see REPORTING-ERRORS

Q3: What systems are available?

A3: Have a look in /usr/share/common-lisp/systems/

Q4: What is the best way to use a ASDF definition file

A4: See the README.packaging document.

Q5: Why can't I use xinetd?

A5: See BTS bug #176464. xinetd doesn't handle unknown services
(that have to be specified with a number, not a name) well. This
breaks the invocation of the daemon.
